   <p><h2>The personal website of Nune/Gigirassy.</h2></p>
   <p>Hello. I am Nune <i>(nu-neh)</i>. My pronouns are ey/em, I have professionally diagnosed brainrot of all sorts (so please be nice), and am quite silly. I am also an anarchist. The world's cutest, in fact.</p>
   <p><h2>I am currently working on:</h2></p>
   <p><ul>
     <li>A Transformers Animated fanfic called Endlings. It is written in multiple different time periods and the main plot is about Cybertronians formed from the sparks of existing ones (called "sparklets") thriving and dealing with issues on a post-apocalyptic, post-second Great War Cybertron, and delving into that past that created them. It has enough gender-diverse people to make the average trufan cry, along with scenes of a violent nature. The fanfic will be written in advance.</li>
    <li>A personal ebook archive where I catalog hundreds of mainly anarchist/revolutionary ebooks.</li>
    <li>Trying to figure out how to host a frontend on this site. The only programming experience I have is HTML and CSS and my PCs don't tend to have the best RAM.</li>
     <li>I honestly am not too public about it at times, but I also make art. <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/nuneshop/shop?asc=u">Give my Redbubble @ nuneshop a look</a>. You can buy zines featuring my art and opinions at Quimby's in Chicago and Indie Northern Kentucky in well...you know already.</li>
   </ul></p>
    <p>I am active on <a href="https://www.tfw2005.com/boards/members/nune.139750/">TFW2005</a>, and Discord ( @gigirassy ).</p>
