   <p><h2>The personal website of Nune.</h2></p>
   <p>Hello. I am Nune <i>(nu-neh)</i>. My pronouns are ey/em, I have professionally diagnosed brainrot of all sorts (so please be nice), and am quite silly. I am also an anarchist. The world's cutest, in fact. I also think Blitzwing is neat.</p>
   <p><h2>I am currently working on:</h2></p>
   <p><ul>
     <li>Several assorted Transformers Animated-related fics and concepts.</li>
     <li>Making more art and working on my OCs.</li>
     <li>Reading more books, particularly fiction and related to my personal philosophical theory.</li>
     <li>Addressing 1312 problems.</li>
     <li>Still trying to get credits for school. I have six more to go.</li>
   </ul></p>

    <p><ul>
      <li>I have an Activator Bumblebee toy who I take on adventures in a fashionable little mesh bag.</li>
      <li>I listen to music, mainly to stim and jump around to. Favorite Vocaloid producers are Dasu, Kikuo, and Masa.</li>
