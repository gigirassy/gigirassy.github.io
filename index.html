  <div id="blitzy"><p>Even by Decepticon standards, Blitzwing is totally insane. He's got three personalities packed into his cyberium-steel chassis, and he argues with himself almost as often as he argues with other Decepticons. The only person he listens to without interrupting is Megatron, because all three of his personalities are terrified of the Decepticon commander. He carries a superheater cannon and a hyperfrost emitter to burn or freeze his enemies.</p>
<p><ul>
  <li>Sometimes changes to tank in midair, and crashes.</li>
  <li>Likes to freeze, then melt his opponents.</li>
  <li>Has trouble flying in a straight line.</li>
</ul></p></div>

  <div id="bio">
   <p>Hello. I am Nune <i>(nu-neh)</i>. I'm a 19 y/o neurospicy-flavored Transformers Animated fanatic who thinks Blitzwing is neat and loves anarchy. I use ey/em pronouns (and trying out lun/luns as a secondary), which work exactly like singular they without the th. I'm also Autigender.</p>
   <p>In my free time, I take funny pictures of my toys, advocate against lawns, do archival, have unhinged convos with my closest friend, and talk/debate about funny robots on <a href="https://www.tfw2005.com/boards/members/nune.139750/">TFW2005</a>.</p>
   <p>The most reliable way to contact me is through Discord or Instagram DMs, both of which are located under the @blitzw.in usernames. If you don't use these services due to privacy reasons, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nune:envs.net">Matrix can also be used at the cost of a later response</a>.</p>
    <p>Now, where would you like to go?</p></div></details></div>
