   <p><h2>The personal website of Nune/Gigirassy.</h2></p>
   <p>Hello. I am Nune. My pronouns are ey/em, I have professionally diagnosed brainrot of all sorts, and am quite silly. I am also an anarchist. The world's cutest, in fact.</p>
   <p><h2>I am currently working on:</h2></p>
   <p><ul>
     <li>A Transformers Animated fanfic called Endlings. It is written in multiple different time periods and the main plot is about Cybertronians formed from the sparks of existing ones (called "sparklets") thriving and dealing with issues on a post-apocalyptic, post-second Great War Cybertron, and delving into that past that created them. It has enough gender-diverse people to make the average trufan cry, along with scenes of a violent nature. The fanfic will be written in advance.</li>
    <li>A personal ebook archive where I catalog hundreds of mainly anarchist/revolutionary ebooks.</li>
   </ul></p>
