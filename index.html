   <p><h2>The personal website of Nune.</h2></p>
   <p>Hello. I am Nune <i>(nu-neh)</i>. I'm a 18 y/o neurospicy-flavored Transformers Animated fanatic who thinks Blitzwing is neat and loves anarchy. I use ey/em pronouns, which work exactly like singular they without the th.</p>
   <p>In my free time, I take funny pictures of my toys, advocate against lawns, do archival, have unhinged convos with my closest friend, and talk/debate about funny robots on <a href="https://www.tfw2005.com/boards/members/nune.139750/">TFW2005</a>.</p>
   <p>The most reliable way to contact me is through Discord or Instagram DMs, both of which are located under the @blitzw.in usernames. If you don't use these services due to privacy reasons, <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nune:envs.net">Matrix can also be used at the cost of a later response</a>.</p>
   <p><a href="https://watchtfa.com/">You should really watch Transformers Animated, by the way</a>.</p>

    <p><h2>Fun facts about me:</h2></p>
    <p><ul>
      <li>I have an Activator Bumblebee toy who I take on adventures in a fashionable little mesh bag.</li>
      <li>I listen to music, mainly to stim and jump around to. Favorite Vocaloid producers are Dasu, Kikuo, and Masa.</li>
      <li>I have a very thick speech impediment because I learned to talk late.</li>
      <li>I have OCs and a subdomain of my site for listing the OCs is coming soon.</li>
