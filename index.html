   <p><h2>The personal website of Nune.</h2></p>
   <p>Hello. I am Nune <i>(nu-neh)</i>. My pronouns are ey/em, I have professionally diagnosed brainrot of all sorts (so please be nice), and am quite silly. I am also an anarchist. The world's cutest, in fact. I also think Blitzwing is neat.</p>
   <p><h2>I am currently working on:</h2></p>
   <p><ul>
     <li>Several assorted Transformers Animated-related fics and concepts.</li>
     <li>A personal ebook archive where I catalog hundreds of mainly anarchist/revolutionary ebooks.</li>
     <li>Trying to figure out how to host more services on this site. Only service I currently host is a <a href="https://random.blitzw.in/">comic book reader</a>.</li>
     <li>Making more art. <a href="https://nuneshop.redbubble.com">I have a Redbubble sticker shop with mainly chibi designs.</a></li>
     <li>Reading more books, particularly fiction and related to my personal philosophical theory.</li>
     <li>Addressing 1312 problems.</li>
   </ul></p>
    <p><h2>Sections of this site:</h2></p>
    <p><ul>
      <li><a href="/collection.html">A page where I track my Transformers collection.</a></li>
      <li><a href="/coolsites.html">Sites I think are neat.</a></li>
      <li><a href="/maq.html">Questions which people may or may not have asked me, but I'm going to share anyway.</a></li>
    </ul></p>
    <p>I am active on <a href="https://www.tfw2005.com/boards/members/nune.139750/">TFW2005</a>, Instagram, and Discord ( both at @blitzw.in ). <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nune:envs.net">I also have a Matrix.</a></p>
    <p>If you like my opinions or work and have expendable income, then I'd like for you to know that I come from a no-income family that relies mainly on government money. <a href="https://ko-fi.com/blitzwing">I have a Ko-Fi you can tip in</a> to migitate at least some of the financial strain of my hobbies or wants. It's much appreciated by me.</p>
    <p><h2>Before you go...</h2></p>
    <p>There used to be a link to a chatbox/guestbook here, but because of abuse, I took it down. Bleh.</p>
