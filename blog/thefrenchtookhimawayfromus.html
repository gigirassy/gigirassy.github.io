   <p><h2>#1: My Quest to Get McDonald's Animated Blitzwing</h2></p>
   <p><h3>(and my theory for why the French took him away from us)</h3></p>
   <p>I recently developed more of a little bit of a hyperfixation on this toy. He's an adorably terrible and doofy-looking toy of my Brainrot Comfort Character. Transformers Animated Blitzwing, that is. The problem? He was only released in French McDonald's for some unholy reason. This was a tragic event. He should belong to the people.</p>

   <p>...especially me. I am officially going on a quest to obtain him. I'll outline my methods here.</p>
   <p>Me and a friend on Discord both want this toy. He found a French site like eBay, and there are two listings for the toy on there.</p>
