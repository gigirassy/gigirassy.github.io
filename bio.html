   <p><h2>The personal bio of Nune.</h2></p>
   <p>Hello. I am Nune <i>(nu-neh)</i>. My pronouns are ey/em, I have professionally diagnosed brainrot of all sorts (so please be nice), and am quite silly. I am also an anarchist. The world's cutest, in fact. This is a subsection of my site for my Discord bio.</p>
   <p><ul>
    <li>18-year-old</li>
    <li>I'm a white-coded and passing Native. (Lenape and Myaamia)</li>
    <li>I'm as emotionally fragile as a roll of tissue paper due to my traumas and brainrot.</li>
    <li>Cassgender and Autigender.</a></li>
    <li>I am known for my hot takes, adorableness, and milk lore. Also my art style, gardening, and activism. I semi-frequently talk about current events, let me know if that makes you uncomfortable.</li>
    <li>This is written in a proper grammar style, but please know that on Discord, I use loads of emotes and shorthands.</li>
    <li>If I left your OSC-related server recently, please don't worry! I have decided to distance myself from the OSC due to mental health reasons. I'm still friends with OSC friends; I just won't be in the community itself! <a href="https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLlcmNU-jCJ6OCQc2UnR8oChy79nIWzyeo">You should watch Transformers Animated instead, it's way cooler.</a></li>
   </ul></p>
