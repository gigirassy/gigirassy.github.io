   <p><h2>The personal bio of Nune.</h2></p>
   <p>Hello. I am Nune <i>(nu-neh)</i>. My pronouns are ey/em and lun/luns (use lun in place of it and that should be correct), I have professionally diagnosed brainrot of all sorts (so please be nice), and am quite silly. I am also an anarchist. The world's cutest, in fact. This is a subsection of my site for my Discord bio.</p>
   <p><ul>
    <li>18-year-old</li>
    <li>I'm a white-coded and passing Native. Feel free to ask non-intrusive questions. (Lenape and Myaamia)</li>
    <li>I'm as emotionally fragile as a roll of tissue paper due to my traumas and brainrot.</li>
    <li>Autigender.</a></li>
    <li>I semi-frequently talk about current events, let me know if that makes you uncomfortable.</li>
    <li>This is written in a proper grammar style, but please know that on Discord, I use loads of emotes and shorthands.</li>
    <li><a href="https://www.blitzw.in/contentinteraction.txt">View my content interaction guidelines before interacting with me!</a></li>
    <li><b>I have decided to distance myself from object shows due to mental health and trauma reasons.</b> Looking at object show content often makes me sick to my stomach. <b>Do not bring up my past in the OSC around me</b>, including my ideas, concepts, etc., and avoid discussion of object show characters and OCs if possible. Keep in mind I'm still friends with OSC friends; I just won't be in the community itself or make content for it. <a href="https://yewtu.be/playlist?list=PLlcmNU-jCJ6OCQc2UnR8oChy79nIWzyeo">You should watch Transformers Animated instead, it's not sucky.</a></li>
