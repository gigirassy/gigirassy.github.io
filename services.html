   <p><h2>Blitzwing Services</h2></p>
   <p>These are services I host on subdomains of this site, through VPSes, and simple pages.</p>
   <p>I had some misadventures beforehand, before I realized a VPS with Caddy and Docker would be easier. (and easier it was!)</p>
   <p>Donations: In lieu of giving me money directly, consider contributing to <a href="https://throne.com/gigirassy">my wishlist</a> so I can have more money left to pay for the services. It helps a ton as me and my family have virtually no income at the moment, and it's anonymous as well. Costs for my Hetzner-hosted services total to around 10 euro a month.</p>

   <h3>Not-Publicly Linked Services</h3>
   <p><ul>
     <li>Invidious: This is hosted on a different VPS than what I normally use, one that hasn't been blocked yet. To prevent people from abusing it to the point where the VPS is blocked, you'll have to email me for the link. nune[.at.]imap[.dot.]fi . Doesn't have to be formal, you can just put something like "Can I has Invidious" in the subject with a cute cat pic attached and I'll send it to you. Alias will not be replied to. I won't care about what you watch.</li>
   </ul></p>
   <h3>Planned services</h3>
   <p>If it's not here, please don't inquire about it.</p>
   <p><ul>
     <li>PrivateBin: One day, I'll get it figured out.</li>
