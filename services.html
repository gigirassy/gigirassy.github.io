   <p><h2>Blitzwing Services</h2></p>
   <p>These are services I host on subdomains of this site, through VPSes, and simple pages.</p>
   <p>I had some misadventures beforehand, before I realized a VPS with Caddy and Docker would be easier. (and easier it was!)</p>
   <p>Donations: In lieu of giving me money directly, consider contributing to <a href="https://throne.com/gigirassy">my wishlist</a> so I can have more money left to pay for the services. It helps a ton as me and my family have virtually no income at the moment, and it's anonymous as well. Costs for my Hetzner-hosted services total to around 10 euro a month.</p>

Doesn't have to be formal, you can just put something like "Can I has Invidious" in the subject with a cute cat pic attached and I'll send it to you. Alias will not be replied to.
