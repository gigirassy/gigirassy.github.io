   <p><h2>Blitzwing Services</h2></p>
   <p>These are services I host on subdomains of this site, through VPSes, and simple pages.</p>
   <p>I had some misadventures beforehand, before I realized a VPS with Caddy and Docker would be easier. (and easier it was!)</p>
   <p>Donations: In lieu of giving me money directly, consider contributing to <a href="https://throne.com/gigirassy">my wishlist</a> so I can have more money left to pay for the services. It helps a ton as me and my family have virtually no income at the moment, and it's anonymous as well. Costs for my Hetzner-hosted instance total to around 10 euro a month.</p>
   <h3>Services</h3>
   <p><ul>
     <li><a href="https://search.blitzw.in/">SearXNG</a>: A self-described "metasearch engine" that gathers results from many different search engines without tracking you. Feel free to set it as your default! Hosted on a Hetzner VPS.</li>
     <li><a href="https://random.blitzw.in/">Web-based Comic Book Reader</a>: A copy of Afif Zafri's comic book reader. You can read any comic book file (CBR, CBZ, and the unfortunately named CBT) using it. If you don't have any files, you can still test it out with a few Transformers comics. Hosted on Codeberg Pages at no cost to me.</li>
     <li><a href="https://transfer.blitzw.in">Transfer.Coffee</a>: Transfer files sneakily with the help of a built-in torrent tracker and service. Hosted on a Hetzner VPS.</li>

     <li><a href="https://fan.blitzw.in">Breezewiki</a>: Browse Fandom without being exposed to military ads and cringe comments made by 10-year-olds. (Including my own!) Hosted on a Hetzner VPS.</li>

     <li><a href="https://tools.blitzw.in">IT Tools</a>: Loads of helpful tools for developers, like decoding and encoding stuff, generating QR codes, and more. Hosted on Vercel at no cost to me.</li>
