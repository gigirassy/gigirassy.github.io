   <p><h2>Blitzwing Services</h2></p>
   <p>These are services I host on subdomains of this site, through VPSes, and simple pages.</p>
   <p>I had some misadventures beforehand, before I realized a VPS with Docker and Caddy would be easier. (and easier it was!) If you want an idea of that, check <a href="/services-old.html">the old page</a>.</p>
   <h3>Services</h3>
   <p><ul>
     <li><a href="https://search.blitzw.in/">SearXNG</a>: A self-described "metasearch engine" that gathers results from many different search engines without tracking you. Feel free to set it as your default! Hosted on a Hetzner VPS.</li>
     <li><a href="https://icy.blitzw.in/">Piped</a>: A frontend where you can watch YouTube videos and subscribe to channels without the rich tracking you. It also blocks out annoying parts of videos, like sponsorships.</li>
     <li><a href="https://random.blitzw.in/">Web-based Comic Book Reader</a>: A copy of Afif Zafri's comic book reader. You can read any comic book file (CBR, CBZ, and the unfortunately named CBT) using it. If you don't have any files, you can still test it out with a few Transformers comics.</li>
     <li><a href="https://random.blitzw.in/snowflake.html">Snowflake by Tor</a>: Not really a service, but a page where I embedded a Snowflake proxy that helps people bypass censorship at no cost or risk to you. Feel free to toggle it and then have that page run in the background, like in a separate desktop.</li>
     <li><a href="https://random.blitzw.in/nopaste/">Nopaste</a>: Entirely client-side Pastebin. <b>Warning: PASTES GENERATED HERE DO NOT EXPIRE. Do not use this to share sensitive information. <a href="https://pb.envs.net">Use a Privatebin instance instead, like this one.</a></b></li>
   </ul></p>
   <h3>Planned Services...</h3>
   <p><ul>
     <li>Anonymous Overflow</li>
     <li>IT Tools. Maybe.</li>
