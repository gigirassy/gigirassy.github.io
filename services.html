   <p><h2>Blitzwing Services</h2></p>
   <p>These are services I host on subdomains of this site, through VPSes, and simple pages.</p>
   <p>I had some misadventures beforehand, before I realized a VPS with Caddy would be easier. (and easier it was!) If you want an idea of that, check <a href="/services-old.html">the old page</a>.</p>
   <p>Donations: In lieu of giving me money directly, consider contributing to <a href="https://throne.com/gigirassy">my wishlist</a> so I can have more money left to pay for the services. It helps a ton as I and my family has virtually no income at the moment, and it's anonymous as well. Costs for my SearXNG, Breezewiki, SimplyTranslate, and Transfer.Coffee instance total to around 10 euro a month.</p>
   <h3>Services</h3>
   <p><ul>
     <li><a href="https://search.blitzw.in/">SearXNG</a>: A self-described "metasearch engine" that gathers results from many different search engines without tracking you. Feel free to set it as your default! Hosted on a Hetzner VPS.</li>
     <li><a href="https://random.blitzw.in/">Web-based Comic Book Reader</a>: A copy of Afif Zafri's comic book reader. You can read any comic book file (CBR, CBZ, and the unfortunately named CBT) using it. If you don't have any files, you can still test it out with a few Transformers comics.</li>
     <li><a href="https://transfer.blitzw.in">Transfer.Coffee</a>: Transfer files sneakily with the help of a built-in torrent tracker and service.</li>
     <li><a href="https://hothead.blitzw.in">SimplyTranslate</a>: A translation frontend that doesn't track you! Translate from and to many languages here.</li>
     <li><a href="https://fan.blitzw.in">Breezewiki</a>: Browse Fandom without being exposed to military ads and cringe comments made by 10-year-olds. (Including my own!)</li>
     <li><a href="https://www.blitzw.in/nopaste/">Nopaste</a>: Entirely client-side Pastebin. <b>Warning: PASTES GENERATED HERE DO NOT EXPIRE. Do not use this to share sensitive information. <a href="https://pb.envs.net">Use a Privatebin instance instead, like this one.</a></b></li>
