   <p><h2>Privacy Policy</h2></p>
   <p>I am tired of privacy policies that are worded so that they enable certain corps to take your right to privacy as you either 1) don't want to read them or 2) they use so much academic language that you don't understand. I'll be straight to the point here.</p>

   <p><h3>Data:</h3></p>
   <p><ul>
     <li>None. My site doesn't keep any data from people viewing, including those under the age of 13.</li>
     <li>In fact, this main site is a collection of static pages made of HTML and CSS with absolutely no Javascript. I don't even use a framework, and purposefully built my site to load and run properly on even the oldest browsers. I'll make a page about this sometime.</li>
     <li>The comic book reader located on random.blitzw.in uses Javascript, but not any type able to track your activity. All comics read are stored locally in blobs.</li>
   </ul></p>
   
   <p><h3>Hosting:</h3></p>
   <p><ul>
     <li>I bought my domain from <a href="https://gandi.net">Gandi.net</a>, and I configured <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to this site, which allows this site to have the content you love and hate.</li>
     <li>The domain suffix is the top-level domain for India, and India has licensed it to domain providers so sites all over the world, like mine, can use it.</li>
     <li>The random.blitzw.in comic book reader uses Codeberg Pages instead of Github Pages.</li>
   </ul></p>

   <p><h3>External sites:</h3></p>
   <p><ul>
     <li>I'm not responsible for the data that might be stolen by external sites I might link, such as Redbubble, a pretty gosh darn crappy corp by itself. I practice basic privacy while using the web myself, and you should too.</li>
   </ul></p>
    <p>Now that you've read all this, have a cookie. You can imagine it in your head.</p>
