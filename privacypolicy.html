   <p><h2>Privacy Policy</h2></p>
   <p>I am tired of privacy policies that are worded so that they enable certain corps to take your right to privacy as you either 1) don't want to read them or 2) they use so much academic language that you don't understand. I'll be straight to the point here.</p>

   <p><h3>Data:</h3></p>
   <p><h4>Main Site</h4>
    <ul>
     <li>None. My main site doesn't keep any browser data or cookies from people viewing, including those under the age of 13.</li>
     <li>In fact, the site is a collection of static pages made of HTML and CSS with absolutely no Javascript. I don't even use a framework, and purposefully built my site to load and run properly on even the oldest browsers. I'll make a page about this sometime.</li>
   </ul>
  <h4>Services</h4>
    <ul>
     <li>I do not keep any logs or check them for any of my privacy services except for upkeep. The VPS-hosted services are hosted in Germany.</li>
     <li>Transfer.blitzw.in is based on a built-in Webtorrent tracker and does not host any content itself.</li>
     <li>I am not responsible for your usage of the services.</li>
   </ul></p>
   
   <p><h3>Hosting:</h3></p>
   <p><ul>
     <li>I bought my domain from <a href="https://gandi.net">Gandi.net</a>, and I configured <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to this site, which allows this site to have the content you love and hate.</li>
     <li>The domain suffix is the top-level domain for India, and India has licensed it to domain providers so sites all over the world, like mine, can use it.</li>
     <li>The random.blitzw.in comic book reader uses Codeberg Pages instead of Github Pages.</li>
   </ul></p>

   <p><h3>External sites:</h3></p>
   <p><ul>
     <li>I'm not responsible for the data that might be stolen by external sites I might link. I practice basic privacy while using the web myself, and you should too.</li>
   </ul></p>
    <p>Now that you've read all this, have a cookie. You can imagine it in your head.</p>
