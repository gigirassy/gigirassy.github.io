   <p><h2>Maybe-Asked Questions</h2></p>
   <p>Stuff you may or may not want to ask me about, but I'm going to answer anyways.</p>

   <div id="myself"><p><h3>Myself:</h3></p>
    
     <div id="who"><p><h4>Who are you?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">I'm Nune. I'm a neurospicy often-online Autigender anarcho-archivist. I draw. I'm a TFA Blitzwing fanatic. And sometimes, I'm pretty cringe.</p></div>
    
     <div id="pronouns"><p><h4>How do I use your pronouns?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">In my case, they work exactly like they/them, just without the th. This shouldn't be too hard to figure out.</p></div>

     <div id="autigender"><p><h4>What does Autigender mean?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">That autism influences how I see my nonbinary gender. It's a pretty recent label coined by the Autistic community, but it's not a new concept.</p></div>
   
     <div id="hobbies"><p><h4>What hobbies do you have?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">A lot. I do archival, draw, be the world's cutest anarchist, take funny pictures of my toys, take those toys on adventures, share current events commentary, and more. I also garden.</p></div>

     <div id="name"><p><h4>What does your (online) name mean?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">It's the Lenape verb for a baby nursing. Picked it to be cutesy while fitting with my cultural heritage back in mid-2021 and never looked back.</p></div>

     <div id="gigirassy"><p><h4>What the heck is a Gigirassy?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">Long ago as a 12 year old in 2018, I went by the name "ggrassy" on social media, naming myself after a character, "Grassy" from the animated web series Battle for Dream Island. I eventually abandoned that persona. Then in 2020, I decided to come back to main social media under a previously-abandoned account named by that on FANDOM. Then, it became Gigirassy, because I had previously called myself Gigi after the first two letters in that name. I don't go by Gigi anymore. However, the alias "Gigirassy" serves as an artifact.</p></div>
    
     <div id="blitzwing"><p><h4>Why do you like Blitzwing so much?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">I just think he's a neat funny guy and I slightly relate to him. Animated Blitzwing is not the only incarnation of him I appreciate.</p></div>

     <div id="ideology"><p><h4>Ok, so you're an anarchist. What's your specific political ideology?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">Semi-pacifistic furry plant anarchism with abolitionist and bootlegging/shadow archival-supporting priorities. <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/mirror/a/ay/angela-y-davis-are-prisons-obsolete.pdf">Books are fun.</a></p></div>

     <div id="weird"><p><h4>Why are you weird?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">Being a cool weirdo is an act of bravery.</p></div>

     <div id="ebooks"><p><h4>Can I have a link to your anarchist/revolutionary ebook archive?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;"><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nune:envs.net">Sure, shoot me a message on the Matrix protocol.</a></p></div>
