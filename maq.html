     <div id="autigender"><p><h4>What does Autigender mean?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">That autism influences how I see my nonbinary gender. It's a pretty recent label coined by the Autistic community, but it's not a new concept.</p></div>
   
     <div id="hobbies"><p><h4>What hobbies do you have?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">A lot. I do archival, draw, be the world's cutest anarchist, take funny pictures of my toys, take those toys on adventures, share current events commentary, and more. I also garden.</p></div>

     <div id="name"><p><h4>What does your (online) name mean?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">It's the Lenape verb for a baby nursing. Picked it to be cutesy while fitting with my cultural heritage back in mid-2021 and never looked back.</p></div>

     <div id="gigirassy"><p><h4>What the heck is a Gigirassy?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">Long ago as a 12 year old in 2018, I went by the name "ggrassy" on social media, naming myself after a character, "Grassy" from the animated web series Battle for Dream Island. I eventually abandoned that persona. Then in 2020, I decided to come back to main social media under a previously-abandoned account named by that on FANDOM. Then, it became Gigirassy, because I had previously called myself Gigi after the first two letters in that name. I don't go by Gigi anymore. However, the alias "Gigirassy" served as an artifact I had wanted to keep. Until now. I hate that name now.</p></div>
    
     <div id="blitzwing"><p><h4>Why do you like Blitzwing so much?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">I just think he's a neat funny guy and I relate to him. We're both brainfunky, speak in funky ways, and have frequent mood swings. Animated Blitzwing is not the only incarnation of him I appreciate.</p></div>

     <div id="ideology"><p><h4>Ok, so you're an anarchist. What's your specific political ideology?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">Semi-pacifistic Furry plant anarchism with abolitionist and bootlegging/shadow archival-supporting priorities. Books are fun. (<a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/mirror/a/ay/angela-y-davis-are-prisons-obsolete.pdf">1</a> / <a href="https://cdn.nakamotoinstitute.org/docs/against-intellectual-monopoly.pdf">2</a>) </p></div>

     <div id="weird"><p><h4>Why are you weird?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">Being a cool weirdo is an act of bravery.</p></div>

     <div id="ebooks"><p><h4>Can I have a link to your anarchist/revolutionary ebook archive?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;"><a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nune:envs.net">Sure, shoot me a message on the Matrix protocol.</a></p>

     <div id="job"><p><h4>Are you employed?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">Nope. My family has absolutely no income other than government and cashback money.</p>

     <div id="exit"><p><h4>Where is the nearest exit?</h4></p>
     <p style="padding-left:10px;">Ideally below.</p>
